# UPSC-Notes-Manju
A syllabus-aligned UPSC current affairs and notes repository for Prelims and Mains. Focused on converting high-value news into concise, exam-ready capsules with facts, analysis, and answer-ready examples. Organized by GS papers for quick revision and long-term retention.



This repository is a structured, syllabus-aligned collection of UPSC Current Affairs and static-linked notes, maintained for Prelims, Mains, and Interview preparation.

The primary objective of this repository is to convert daily news into concise, exam-ready insights, avoiding information overload while ensuring high recall and easy revision. All content is organized strictly according to the UPSC GS syllabus, not newspaper sections.

Each entry follows a capsule-based approach:

Key facts for Prelims

Analytical points for Mains

Governance, constitutional, or ethical angles where relevant

One-line examples usable directly in answers

The repository emphasizes:

Environment & Biodiversity

Polity, Governance, and Judiciary

Economy

Science & Technology

International Relations

Ethics case examples

Notes are written in Markdown format for clarity, speed of revision, and long-term maintainability. Content is regularly trimmed, updated, and refined to keep it relevant till the Mains examination.

This repo is not a daily news archive.
Only high-value issues, landmark initiatives, policies, judgments, and governance practices are included — those that can be directly applied in answers or MCQs.


GitHub is used deliberately as a free, version-controlled, distraction-free platform to ensure:

Anywhere access

Clean revision

Long-term consistency

Zero dependency on paid apps

This repository is intended to be a living document, evolving with preparation, and serving as a single-point revision source before Prelims and Mains.
