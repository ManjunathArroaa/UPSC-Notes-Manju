## CPI Base Year Revision & Inflation Measurement (India)

### What is CPI
- Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures **retail inflation**
- Used by **RBI for inflation targeting (4% ± 2%)**
- Compiled by **National Statistical Office (NSO)**

---

### Base Year Update
- Old CPI base year: **2012**
- New CPI base year: **2024**
- New weights derived from **Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023–24**

---

### Why Revision Was Necessary
- Consumption patterns have changed significantly since 2012
- Rising share of **services, health, education, transport**
- Subsidies and welfare schemes altered household spending
- Old CPI underestimates actual inflation experienced by households

---

### CPI Weight Structure (2012 Base Year) – Prelims Focus
- **Food & Beverages**: ~46% (highest weight)
- **Miscellaneous (Services)**: ~28%
- **Housing**: ~10% (urban only)
- **Fuel & Light**: ~7%
- **Clothing & Footwear**: ~6%

**Key Insight**
- Food inflation has a disproportionate impact on headline CPI
- New CPI likely to **reduce food weight and increase services weight**

---

### Issue with Old CPI
- Gap between official inflation and household perception
- RBI Inflation Expectations Survey shows higher perceived inflation
- Weak linkage between low CPI inflation and private consumption growth

---

### Significance of CPI Revision
- Improves accuracy of inflation measurement
- Strengthens **monetary policy decision-making**
- Enhances credibility of macroeconomic data
- Better targeting of welfare and subsidies

---

### One-line Mains Use
> Updating the CPI base year aligns inflation measurement with evolving consumption patterns and improves the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policymaking.
